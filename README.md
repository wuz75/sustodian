when your high throughput codes just aren't (slurm edition)

Use CheckIncar.sh when you have an error.1.tar.gz file and want to know wtf custodian did to it

Use FindMyFW.sh when you don't know which job is being run but you have the jobid
when you run it, it will give you your current jobs and just copy and paste one of the jobids to the command prompt


you can chmod +x thefile.sh to give it permissions
then add it to an alias
